# pt8211-with-Teensy-4.1

Example from FrankB (I2SFrequency) to change the sampling frequency of Teensy 4.1

With this example we can make the PT8211 sampling frequency arbitrary.

Also, in this example,i stripped down the sinewave oscillator to make it easier to understand (for those who don't have C++/OO background).
